The increasing awareness and adoption of advanced therapeutic options are further fueling the market growth. Additionally, the growing preference for minimally invasive surgeries, which are associated with faster recovery times and lower complication rates, is driving the demand for stents. The market is also supported by significant investments in research and development aimed at improving stent materials, designs, and delivery systems.</p> <p>Furthermore, the rise in chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, and diverticulitis has amplified the need for digestive tract stents, as these conditions often result in bowel obstructions or strictures. The growing number of elderly individuals, who are more prone to gastrointestinal disorders, has also contributed to the overall market expansion.
